# John Lennon's Imagine

&emsp;&emsp;披头士成员 [John Lennon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon) 脍炙人口的作品 _[Imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song))_ 传唱五洲，但我从 _[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time)_ 这张专辑里才开始认真听、反复听。充满诗意的旋律，比肩 J.S. Bach's _[Air on the G String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_on_the_G_String)_；歌词是美好的乌托邦，人类永远的梦，无法实现的梦。

    Imagine there's no heaven
    It's easy if you try
    No hell below us
    Above us only sky
    Imagine all the people living for today (Aha-ah...)

    Imagine there's no countries
    It isn't hard to do
    Nothing to kill or die for
    And no religion too
    Imagine all the people living life in peace (You...)

    You may say I'm a dreamer
    But I'm not the only one
    I hope some day you'll join us
    And the world will be as one

    Imagine no possessions
    I wonder if you can
    No need for greed or hunger
    A brotherhood of man
    Imagine all the people sharing all the world (You...)

    You may say I'm a dreamer
    But I'm not the only one
    I hope some day you'll join us
    And the world will live as one
